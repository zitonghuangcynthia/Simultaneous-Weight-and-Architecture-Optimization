## Code Structure

The repository is divided into two main parts:

1. **Train Autoencoder**
   - This part focuses on training the autoencoder.
   - Code and resources related to this are located in the `training_autoencoder` folder.

2. **Train MLP**
   - This part is responsible for training the MLP models.
   - Code and resources for this are found in the `training_MLP` folder.

Please refer to the respective folders for detailed instructions and usage examples.
